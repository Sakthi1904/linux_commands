| Macro                   | Full Form                | Purpose                                                                 | Return Value (when applicable)                                                                 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`WIFEXITED(status)`**  | Wait If Exited           | Checks if the child terminated normally.                               | **Non-zero** if the child terminated normally (via `exit()` or returning from `main()`).<br>**0** if not. |
| **`WEXITSTATUS(status)`**| Wait Exit Status         | Retrieves the exit status of the child if it terminated normally.      | **Integer value** representing the exit status (if `WIFEXITED(status)` is true).<br>Valid only if `WIFEXITED(status)` is true. |
| **`WIFSIGNALED(status)`**| Wait If Signaled         | Checks if the child was terminated by a signal.                        | **Non-zero** if the child terminated due to a signal.<br>**0** if not.                        |
| **`WTERMSIG(status)`**   | Wait Termination Signal  | Retrieves the signal number that caused the child to terminate.        | **Signal number** (if `WIFSIGNALED(status)` is true).<br>Valid only if `WIFSIGNALED(status)` is true. |
| **`WIFSTOPPED(status)`** | Wait If Stopped          | Checks if the child process was stopped (paused) due to a signal.      | **Non-zero** if the child was stopped.<br>**0** if not.                                         |
| **`WSTOPSIG(status)`**   | Wait Stop Signal         | Retrieves the signal number that caused the child to stop.             | **Signal number** (if `WIFSTOPPED(status)` is true).<br>Valid only if `WIFSTOPPED(status)` is true. |
| **`WIFCONTINUED(status)`**| Wait If Continued       | Checks if the child process was resumed after being stopped.           | **Non-zero** if the child was resumed (i.e., continued with `SIGCONT`).<br>**0** if not.        |
| **`WNOHANG`**            | Wait No Hang             | Makes `waitpid()` non-blocking (returns immediately if no child has terminated). | **`0`** if no child has terminated and `waitpid()` is called with `WNOHANG`. |
| **`WUNTRACED`**          | Wait Untraced            | Tells `waitpid()` to return if a child has stopped (not terminated).   | **Non-zero** if a stopped child is encountered by `waitpid()`.<br>**0** if no stopped child.   |
| **`WCONTINUED`**         | Wait Continued           | Tells `waitpid()` to return when a stopped child is resumed.           | **Non-zero** if a stopped child was resumed.<br>**0** if no resumed child.                      |
